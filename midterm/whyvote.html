<p>If you ever think that just one vote in a sea of millions cannot make much of a difference, consider some of the closest elections in U.S. history.</p>

<p>In 2000, Al Gore narrowly lost the Electoral College vote to George W. Bush. The election came down to a recount in Florida, where Bush had won the popular vote by such a small margin that it triggered an automatic recount and a Supreme Court case (Bush v. Gore). In the end, Bush won Florida by 0.009 percent of the votes cast in the state, or 537 votes. Had 600 more pro-Gore voters gone to the polls in Florida that November, there may have been an entirely different president from 2000–2008.</p>

<p>More recently, Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in 2016 by securing a close Electoral College win. Although the election did not come down to a handful of votes in one state, Trump’s votes in the Electoral College decided a tight race. Clinton had won the national popular vote by nearly three million votes, but the concentration of Trump voters in key districts in “swing” states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan helped seal enough electoral votes to win the presidency.</p>

<p>Your vote may not directly elect the president, but if your vote joins enough others in your voting district or county, your vote undoubtedly matters when it comes to electoral results. Most states have a “winner take all” system where the popular vote winner gets the state’s electoral votes. There are also local and state elections to consider. While presidential or other national elections usually get a significant voter turnout, local elections are typically decided by a much smaller group of voters.</p>

	<h4 id="swingstates"> Swing States for 2020</h4>
	<p>What is a "swing state":</p>
	<p>A swing states, are comprised of mixed populations (urban, suburban, rural, etc.) and tend to flip between red and blue each election cycle.</p>
	<p>Swing States for 2020:</p>
	<li>Arizona</li>
	<li>Cliorado</li>
	<li>Florida</li>
	<li>Georgia</li>
	<li>Iowa</li>
	<li>Maine</li>
	<li>Michigan</li>
	<li>North Carolina</li>
	<li>Ohio</li>
	<li>Pennsylvania</li>
	<li>Texas</li>
	<li>Wisconsin</li>

	<p>Swing states are the most critical states in the upcoming 2020 election. They're essentially the tipping point of who's going to win the electoral college, then win the presidency</p>

	<p>In 1788 the founding fathers of the United States establish the Electoral College. The American people do not directly elect the President. Instead, the Electoral College elects the President.</p>

	<p>In 1789, George Washington was then elected as the first President of the United States.</p>

	<p>In 1866, The 14th Amendment to the Constitution is passed by Congress. It states that men age 21 and over who are residents of the United States have the right to vote. Any state preventing these rights will lose electors in the Electoral College. Women still do not have the right to vote.</p>

	<p>On August 18, 1920, the U.S. Congress passes the 19th Amendment to the Constitution giving women the right to vote. However, in 1911, California passed a law that gave women the right to vote.</p>

	<p>In 1975, Congress expanded the Voting Rights Act to protect the voting rights of those people who do not speak or read English.</p>
