		<p>For my Homework 7 I chose to do it about Yayoi Kusama a Japanese contemporary artist who works primarily in sculpture and installation, but is also active in painting, performance, film, fashion, poetry, fiction, and other arts. Her work is based in conceptual art and shows some attributes of feminism, minimalism, surrealism, Art Brut, pop art, and abstract expressionism, and is infused with autobiographical, psychological, and sexual content. She has been acknowledged as one of the most important living artists to come out of Japan.</p><br>

		<h4>Background about Kusama</h4>
		<p>Yayoi Kusama a Japanese contemporary artist who works primarily in sculpture and installation, but is also active in painting, performance, film, fashion, poetry, fiction, and other arts. Her work is based in conceptual art and shows some attributes of feminism, minimalism, surrealism, Art Brut, pop art, and abstract expressionism, and is infused with autobiographical, psychological, and sexual content. She has been acknowledged as one of the most important living artists to come out of Japan</p><br>

		 <p>She (Kusama) struggled mental illness as a child, and was thoroughly abused by her mother, the young artist persevered by using her hallucinations and personal obsessions as fodder for prolific artistic output in various disciplines. This has informed a lifelong commitment to creativity at all costs despite the artist's birth into a traditional, female-effacing Japanese culture and her career's coming of age in the male dominated New York art scene. Today, Kusama reigns as one of the most unique and famous contemporary female artists, operating from her self-imposed home in a mental hospital.</p><br>

		<h4>Overall why I chose Kusama</h4>
		<p>Kusama is known for her abstract pieces of art, colorful exhibits, and polka dot theme in her works of art that has led her to become one of the most popular artists not only in Japan but in the world. That being said,I chose to do my Homework 7 because I once saw a documentary about her previously and I was fascinated by how different and abstract her exhibits and artworks are. Also, her fashion and style is very unique and intriguing to me. Overall, I hope to one day visit one of her many exihibits that can be found globally. In fact, it's also interesting to note that one of her pieces Kusama: Cosmic Nature came to the New York Botanical Gardens in Janurary of 2020!</p><br>
