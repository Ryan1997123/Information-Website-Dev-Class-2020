                            Elizabeth Woolridge Grant (born June 21, 1985), known by her stage name Lana Del Rey, is an American singer-songwriter. Her music is noted for its stylized, cinematic quality; themes of sadness, tragic romance, glamor, and melancholia; and references to pop culture, particularly 1950s and 1960s Americana.
                             Born in New York City and raised in upstate New York, Del Rey returned to New York City in 2005 to begin her music career.
                            Following numerous projects, including her self-titled debut studio album, Del Rey's breakthrough came with the viral success of her debut single "Video Games" in 2011.
                            She signed with Interscope and Polydor later that year. Her major label debut, Born to Die (2012), was an international success and spawned a top-ten single "Summertime Sadness" on the Billboard Hot 100, as well as the singles "Blue Jeans" and "Born to Die", which charted in several overseas territories. She also attended Fordham University for College.
