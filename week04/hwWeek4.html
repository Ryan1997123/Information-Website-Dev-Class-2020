<p>For Week 4 I read <q>As We May Think</q> by Vannevar Bush.
	<br>Bush wrote this article in 1945, where he talks about how, <q>the advances in technology are important to giving man access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages.</q>

	<br>
	 What I found interesting about this reading was how Bush describes the advancement in technology for automobiles, type writers, and movie cameras. 
	 Bush understood that technology was reliable although rather perplex to him and his peers for the time period.
	 also really liked Bush's appreciation for science and technology, and when he say that mans use of science and new instruments would help man control his material environment and quote: 
	<blockquote>
	<i>
	They (tech and new instruments) have improved his food, his clothing, his shelter; 
	They have increased his security and released him partly from the bondage of bare existence.
	<br>They are illuminating the interactions of his physiological and psychological functions, giving the promise of an improved mental health.
    </i>
	</blockquote>	
</p>
	<br>
	<p>I found this quote to be very interesting because it really gets to the point that Bush is trying to make in this article. 
	That is to say, Bush is explaining how Science and Technology has changed our world and for the better.
	In the article, Bush also describes the progress in photography and he describes how this changes our world
	With faster material and lenses, more automatic cameras, and the idea of a minicamera at mention.
	Bush would agree that these advancements allow mankind to trend ahead/advance to the tech of the future more logically 
	I really enjoyed this read as an aspiring Data Scientist myself, and as someone who enjoys photography as a hobby.
	Thus, I would have to say my favorite quote from Bush in the reading is the following:
	<blockquote>
		<i>The repetitive processes of thought are not confined however, to matters of arithmetic and statistics. 
		In fact, every time one combines and records facts in accordance with established logical processes, the creative aspect of thinking is concerned only with the selection of the data and the process to be employed 
		 and the manipulation thereafter is repetitive in nature and hence a fit matter to be relegated to the machine
		</i>
	</blockquote>
	</p>
	<p>I believe that Bush is trying to say here that our thoughts and mistakes that we make as human beings do not exist in machines.
		That is to say, we might make a mistake when recording data or doing a task, but for machines/technology it is a matter of numbers and statistics
		Therefore, Bush would agree that while the works of a machine do produced fast and accurate results, the nature of which the machine gets tasks done is cold in a sense because it is performing at a rate of zeros and ones. 
		Interestingly, Bush awes at the advancements in science and technology given to man to and quote <q> live healthilty therein (a well-supplied house for example)</q>
		However, Bush does note too that advancements in technology and science does have an evil side and may enable mankind to start wars against each other with <q>cruel weapons</q> according to the words of Bush. 
		In therfore, mankind may perish in conflict before we learn to understand the true good of eachother and technology,according to Bush.
	</p>
	

	<p>I found it interesting too how Bush also argues for the side of technology with saying and quote:
	<q>They may yet allow him truly to encompass the great record and to grow in the wisdom of race experience</q>
	So, I agree with this statement and with what Bush says about science where; 
	<q>Science has provided the swiftest communication between individuals, it has provided a record of ideas and has enabled man to manipulate and to make extracts from that record so that knowledge evolves and endures throughout the life of a race rather than that of an individual</q>
	</p>

	<br>
	<br>
	
	<p>
		<b><ul>Final Thoughts: </ul></b>
		Overall, I found this reading intriguing and I feel it is relevant especially in a time where science and tech are changing rapidly
	I also liked how the article was formatted and labelled making it very easy to follow along with the story. I found Bush's study of both sides of science and technology to be informing, and, in a way, ahead of its time. I really liked how Bush mentions the advancement of photography and automobiles to make a point. However, what's most interesting is the twist he has at the end of the article where overall in the story he seems to have a fascination with the advancement of tech and science, but we learn that he also understands the danger and destruction that it can pose when humanity has too much power.</p>

<h3>Long Live The Web by Tim Berners Lee: </h3>

<p>In this story, the author, Tim Berners Lee, who is responsible for inventing the World Wide Web, discusses the threats that have come to the World Wide Web and the history as well as the future of the WWW. I found it interesting how Lee mentions that large social networking sites are walling off information posted by their users from the rest of the Web. I remember this issue coming up in the news a few years ago where Wireless Internet providers were tempted to slow traffic to sites with which they have not made deals. Lee in this article makes the point that we must protect the freedoms of the World Wide Web and not allow big corporations like Apple,Facebook, etc to alter that freedom. Because, as Lee says,<q>The primary design principle underlying theWeb’s usefulness and growth is universality.</q>
 </p>

 <p>
 	I really like this article because it examples how important the World Wide Web really is and how important the freedoms we have on the WWW are that we take for granted. That is to say, I agree with Lee when he says that Governments (totalitarian and democratic alike) should not be allowed to monitor people and their online habits. Because doing so is to endanger important human rights. In other words, the freedom to build our own website without a company/anyones approval is crucial to a free WWW, in my opinion, and according to Lee. I also like Lee's point about having "open standards" for the World Wide Web or a "royalty free" (no need to pay) WWW for developers and internet users.
 </p>


 <p>
 	<b><ul>Final Thoughts: </ul></b>	
 	I think Lee says it best when saying <q>As long as the web’s basic principles are upheld, its ongoing evolution is not in the hands of any one person or organization neither mine nor anyone else’s. If we can preserve the principles, the Web promises some fantastic future capabilities.</q> I agree that a royalty free WWW is so important for everyone and governments and big coorporatios should not be allowed to interfere with the freedoms of the WWW. In other words, the goal of the Web is to serve humanity, not big corporations and totalitarian governments. As Lee says best here: 
 <blockquote>
 <i>
 	We build it now so that those who come to it later will be able to create things that we cannot ourselves imagine.
 </i>
</blockquote>
