<h3>My Reaction</h3>
	<p>In John Berger's "Way of Seeing" he examines how we as humans examine works of art at different perspectives. In other words, Berger explains how the way we perceive a work of art is dependent on our cultural background and societal norms. That is to say, we process what image we see based solely upon our own experiences. Therefore, the definiton of what is art and what is not art can change dependent upon each person because everybody has difference life experiences.</p>

	<p>Further, Berger gives the example of the icon in Episode 1 where worshippers converge upon the holy site and behind its image is God, but the followers do not need to keep looking at the image, they close their eyes because they know the meaning behind it. Berger argues that the signifance of the location of an art piece and viewing art has change as well. For example, he describes how the people these days can view the holy icon in their own house because of technology. In other words, <q>the images come to you, you do not go to them, the days of pilgrimage are over.</q> Berger argues that reproductions of original paintings are distort and what we see on a camera or postcard is not the same, because the original painting is unlike any other in the world. We are able to <q>feel the painting</q>and perhaps better understand its message when we view it in person over viewing works of art through technology.</p>
	
	<p>Moreover, Berger argues that in images and in society, men and women are represented differently. That is to say, Berger describes how men have agency, and women are mostly represented as projection of their self. In other words, according to Berger,"men act while women appear." This relationship, Berger points out, is especially perceptible in a certain tradition of European oil painting, which is known for its depiction of nude female figures. So, the ideas of women in art and the female body in art is a discussion that Berger explores further in these episodes, also he mentions the importance of women connecting their identity with paintings/artworks/figures and questions if women do actually connect their identity to pieces of art. </p>
	
	<p>In Episode 1, it was interesting to see how the children viewed Caravaggio's painting of Jesus at a table and how they did not bring their attention to the author of the artwork, but immediately saw how <q>sexually ambivalent</q> the principal figure was in the piece. I found that Bergers attempt to try to relate the experience of art directly to otther experiences through the means of reproduction to be fascinating. I like how in doing so he tried to break down holy relics and paintings as though they were like words on a page. In doing so, Berger argues that images are like words, but because we are in the modern media of communication, when we receive images and meanings, which are arranged, we must be sceptical of these meanings, according to Berger. </p>
	

	<p><q>Men dream of women, women dream of themselves being dreamt of, men look at women, women watch themselves being look at.</q> I believe that Berger here is arguing for the difference in perception of men and women while observing artworks, perhaps. Bergers contrast between the word <q>nude</q> and <q>naked</q> also makes one think. I like Bergers mention of Adam and Eve, when discussing this subject. Two striking facts that Berger argues her is <q>Nakedness is created in the mind of the beholder</q> because Adam and Eve did not know they were naked until they ate the apple. Also, the women in the Adam and Eve story is blamed and punished by being made subservient to the man (Adam) and the man becomes the servant of God. I think Berger is arguing how the narrative changes and the idea of shame is introduced, because it is the spectators looking which shames the characters in the art. <q>The nude implies an awareness of being seen by the spectator, they are not naked as they are, they are naked as you see them</q></p>

	<ul><h3>Final Thoughts:</h3></ul>
	<p>I found Bergers discussions about art to be interesting and his observations about how paintings are best seen in person. Bergers argument of how the complete mood and feeling we have toward a painting is different when we view it through cameras and photography instead of in person. As someone who enjoys photography, I understand what Berger is aruging, because I have had moments where I found something to be beautiful, so I took a photo of set thing, but the photograph sometimes does not capture the full essence and feel as opposed to viewing the thing in person. For example, I may find a beautiful tree in fall and take a photo of it, but in the photo, the mood is less conveyed and can be misunderstood, or even viewed differently because the subject is viewed through a camera lense as opposed to the naked eye.
