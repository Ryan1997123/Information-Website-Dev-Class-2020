<h3>Midterm Project Idea: </h3>


<p>For the Midterm, I chose to do my project about the U.S. Election and Voting. To be more specific, I hope to create a webpage including information about voting and the U.S. elections. That being said, for this webpage, I will include a voting tools tab, a "why you should vote tab", a "contact law makers" tab, and a "stats about the voting and the U.S. 2020 election" tab. In doing so, I hope to educate and assist people with voting in the 2020 election.</p>

<p>I will also include information and background about both candidates and parties running in order to keep you (the viewer of the webpage) informed about who they are voting for and what that candidates policies may represent or not represent for them. I also will include a fact checker for the Presidential and V.P. debates that were most recent. On the main page, I am planning to include three iframes that include news about the election (from unbiased sources), common q&a's about voting, and a covid map. I wanted to include the COVID-19 map so that voters can check if its a good idea to vote in person in their area, or if its best to vote online depending on the number of covid cases in their state.</p><br>
